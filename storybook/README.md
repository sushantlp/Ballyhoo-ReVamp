# Storybook Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example

To get started with Storybook on Now, you can use the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ now init storybook
```

> The only change made is to amend the output directory to `"public"` in the build script.

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Storybook example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
